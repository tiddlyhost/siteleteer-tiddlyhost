# siteleteer-tiddlyhost

This is a fork of [@Alamantus](https://codeberg.org/Alamantus)'
[siteleteer](https://codeberg.org/Alamantus/siteleteer), that aims to add
support for Webdev style "PUT" saves.

The goal is to make it possible to use siteleteer on
[Tiddlyhost](https://tiddlyhost.com/).

To learn more about siteleteer, see the [original readme](README-upstream.md)
and the [siteleteer website](https://alamantus.codeberg.page/siteleteer/#About%20siteleteer).

To learn more about Tiddlyhost, see [tiddlyhost.com](https://tiddlyhost.com/).

>[!WARNING]
> In this fork I may occasionally rebase and force push to main branch.
